### I am just getting into this show so I am not sure how long this will be apart of the list. Dylan Matthews is a self-professed Effective Altruist and as such his approach to the world starts from a place of how can we (humanity) most effectively improve the lives of the most people. Its an ideal I wasn't to familiar with until I began listening to this cast but it has definitely capttured my imagination. I am enjoying it so far, kinda trippy but I like it.
