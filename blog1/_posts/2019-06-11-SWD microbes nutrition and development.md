title: Current Lit (2018) Nutrient-Dependent Impact of Microbes on Drosophila suzukii 
author: Xiao Li Bing, Joseph Gerlach, Gregory Loeb, Nicholas Buchon

### **Context:** 
### Microbes influence the physiology of insects as pathogens, beneficials, and everything in between. Insects that feed in nutrient poor environments (aphids etc.) microbes provide key nutrients. For example, tsetse fly microbes produce vitamins like B for the fly. D. melanogaster lab flies have been shown to have a small yet important microbe community which has been shown to promote development and negatively impact longevity. D. suzukii is a relevent model to study microbiome affects because these insects spend their larval lives developing in fruit. 

### Other bacteria have been shown to produce attractive volatiles. These hidden players (yeast, fungi, bacteria) have also been implicated in affecting the interaction between insects and their hosts. These researchers sought to characterize the relative attractivenbess of SWD to multiple acetic acid bacteria using a two way olfactometer. Next the VOC profiles of bacteria was characterized

### **Ultimate Question:** 
### What role do microbes play in the life history and ecology of other Drosophila species?
---


### **Proximate Goal:** 
+ ### Characterizing the microbiome of wild-type, lab reared, and germ free flies. 
+ ### Understanding the impact of the D. suzukii microbiome on the development and survival of these insects.
---


### **Model:** Developmental comparison between "germ free" and "conventionally reared" flies.
---

### **Methods**

### 1. culturing microbe isolates from wild
### 2. oral inocualtion of flies with microbes
### 3. Generating GF lines and reassociating GF flies with single microbes
### 4. Bacterial community characterization
### 5. Development, longeviety, and fecundity assays and supplement experiements
### 6. RT-qPCR

### **Results**

![framework](/blog1/images/2019Bing_cover.PNG)

### The microbiome of wild caught Drosophila suzukii is highly diverse and varies by season and location. Flies reared in the lab after being caught showed a restricted bacterial load which was less diverse composed mostly of dietary microbes. 

### When comapring performance of flies, the germ-free flies did similarly as well or better than the conventionally reared flies when given nutrient sufficient artificial diets. HOWEVER the germ free flies were not able to develop on two fruit diets but the conventionally reared flies could develop on the two fruit hosts. The ability of a microbe to promote growth was not species specific and many of the microbes were able to "rescue" development on the fruit hosts.

### Germ-free flies showed signs of protein deficiency. The development of symtommatic protein-deficient flies could be resuced by the addition of protein to their fruit diets.

### **A:** Differences in phylogenetic (PD_tree) and species (observes species) diversity among wild caught flies, by season.
### **B:** Qualitative (Unifrac unweighted) assestment of diversity. Season and location have a significant effect on species diversity
### Quantitative (Unifrac weighted) assestemnt of species abundance, each by season. Location has a significant effect on species abundance
### **C:** Microbe differences in phylogenetic diversity and species by sex 
### **D:** Qualitative (Unifrac unweighted) assestment of diversity. Only location has a significant effect on speices diversity
### Quantitative (Unifrac weighted) assestemnt of species abundance by sex. Only location has a significant effect on speices abundance

### **A:** Alpha diversity (mean) estimates for phylogenetic diversity and observed species, between lab reared and wild caught flies.
### **B:** Qualitative (unweighted) estimates of species diversity by location collected and rearing populations. 
### Quantitative (weighted) estimate of species abundance by population and location. 
### These data suggest that being reared in the lab for 10 generations on a uniform diet significantly decreased microbe diversity but these flies retained patterns of diversity

### **A:** Developmental time plot of grem free and conventionally reared flies.
### No significant difference between either group when reared on artificial diet.
### **B:** Adult body weight differences between sex, GF, and CR flies
### GF flies weighed significantly more than CR flies.
### **C:** Adult wing length differences between sex, GF, and CR flies
### Female GF flies had significantly larger wings than CR flies. No significant difference in male wing lenght between GF and CR populations
### **D:** Fecundity differences between GF and CR flies as a function of offspring aduilts per female. SIgnificantly higher in GF females
### **E:** The lifespan of GF and CR adults is significantly longer in GF population

### **A & B:** When most microbes were reassociated with GF flies they were able to rescue GF fly development time and body weight.
### **C & D:** Heat killed yeasts at high doses could rescue GF fly developpment and body weight. Body weight of GF flies given yeasts were similar to GF+microbe flies
### **E & F:** When rearing flies on fruit hosts, supplementing protein into the fruit hosts and supplementing the fruit host with heat killed yeast was able to rescue development time and body weight

### **Discussion**
### SWD in protein rich / nutrient sufficient environments do not require microbes for developmnent
### SWD in protien poor environments, microbes are essential for development
### These results suggests a modulating role for microbes in SWD depending on the SWD physiological environment.
### The microbes associated with SWD was only specific to microbe families, not species
### Microbe communities vary significantly by season and location of SWD
#### SWD could be more reliant on microbes than other insects? (Blum et al. 2013)
### The yeast H. uvarum was attractive to female SWD when added to blueberries, its the most prevalent in the wild, females tend to feed more on yeast associated fruit (Hamby et al. 2012). When scientists mixed H. uvarum and an insecticide female flies laid fewer eggs and had a higher death rate. (Mori et al. 2017)
