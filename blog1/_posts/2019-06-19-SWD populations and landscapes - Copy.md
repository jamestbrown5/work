### **Context:** 
### Landscapes (natural habitats, compositional, and configurational diversity) and management practices (tillage, pesticide use, non-cropping areas) shape Pest and natural enemy populations. Management practices are also driven by surrounding landscapes. Landscape heterogeneity can impact pests in perrinial systems via spill over as insects move between managed and unmanaged aras to complete thier life cycle. Perrinial systems cannot be reset. higher landscape diversity has been shown to increase insect populatios at the large scale. THe challenge in local systems is difficult because of the challenges of monitoring pest-prey interactions. SWD is one of these pests where more information about this interaction is needed because few natural enemies have been found.

### **Proximate Goal:** 
### Compare management systems and spatial variation on SWD and beneficial pops. Explain SWD and beneficial pop. distributions using land use maps. Assess the effects of spatial location and land use patterns on predator-prey interactions by monitoring the gut content of predators
---


### **Model:** 
### SWD and SWD-predators wild populations, landscape heterogenity
---

---
### **Hypothesis:** none statedcoi
### Objective 1: Compare management systems and local spatial variation on SWD abd natural enemy distribution
### Objective 2: Compare land-use indicies deveied from maps to explain distributions of SWD and natural enemies in blueberry systems
### Objective 3: Assess effect of local spatial location and land use patterns on predator-prey interactions via molecular analysis of gut contents
---


### **Results**
### Salticide spiders were the most abundant predator
### SWD most common in pine forest margins of blueberry fields compared to interior of blueberry field
### Natural enemy pops influenced by mgmt: organic > conventional 
### Natural enemy pops influenced spatially: pine margins > edge or interior 
### Natural enemy pops higher with vegetation between rows
### SWD pops highly variable BUT: landscape hetero > landscape homo
### SWD pops effect size positively correlated with non-cropping habitat

### **Discussion**
### Summary: SWD highest in diverse landscapes with complex configs. SWD pops higher in margins THAN fields with contrasting management schemes. Natural enemy pops lower in landscapes with more non cropping areas. These landscapes had lower SWD predation and higher predation on other prey. Complex landscapes with less natural enemy activity and lower predation on SWD appears to be an open niche that these flies are exploiting
### 4.1 Local Mgmt and Location: SWD pops possibly prefer pine forests compared to adjacent organic and conventional field. Suggests pine forests may act as a refuge for SWD pops during intense mgmt. Natural Enemies at lower abundance in conventional fields and higher abundance at the margins of pine forests compared to in field locations
### 4.2 Landscape, SWD, and Enemies: Perrinial systems exist in moasic of other systems. Poly pests benefit from configurational hetero because more resources are available. Being closer to a wider array of non crop hosts could result in higher pops of SWD. Enemies were negatively impacted by local hetero. In managed fields with non cropping habitat had low enemy abundance. This suggests that blueberry systems have filtered the species pool in favor of generalists that prefer ag systems. 
### 4.3 Predator-Pest Intrx: canopy data of SWD catch and enemy catch was low. 0.4% of the spiders tested had SWD gut content.

### **Methods**
### Land-use maps: ARCGIS
### Predator sampling: during major fruit production stages
### SWD sampling: with yeast/sugar baited traps
### Predator sampling: vacuum sample, identified to order
### Stats: two-way interaction and linear mixed model
### Gut analysis: PCR IDs of SWD in the gut content of predators using recently published primers
