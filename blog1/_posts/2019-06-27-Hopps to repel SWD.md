### **Context:** 
### Soft fruits have little in the way of insect protection outside of calander based broad spectrum insecticide IPM. Using repellents to detur insect is less common but on the rise. In D. melanogaster there are compounds and oils known to be repellent (1-octen-3-ol, thymol oil, etc).

### **Proximate Goal:** 
### The potential of hops as a repellent for SWD in greenhouses and field sites
---


### **Model** 
### Repellent treatment: Thymol oil and 1-octen-3-ol, and hop varities. Attractant treatment: fruit or attractant medium.

### **Gap In Knowledge** 
### For SWD growers rely heavily on in
---


### **Results**
### Greenhouse exp: No difference between attractive treatments detected. Mortality rate similar to colony, Hop with ID: HOP00 was significantly different than attractive treatment, HOP07 and HOP03 reduced oviposition, repellents reduced oviposition.
### Field: pest pressure was high at the start of the season and trailed off at the end of the season. No sig diff was detectable for the hop or the repllent treated plots compared to the control. Thymol showed a reduction over time but in raspberries this spray was toxic to the plant. 
### Hop volatiles:
