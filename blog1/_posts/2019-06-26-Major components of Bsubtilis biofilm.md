title: A major protein component of the Bacillus subtilis biofilm matrix

### **Context:** 
### Extracellular matrix has been shown to be a major player in biofilm formation and maintenance. Our current understanding of biofilms is limited but we do know they tend to be composed of macromolecules: polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids produced by the cell. B. subtilis makes a biofilm in liquid by changing its growth pattern from single cell to form a long chain of individual microbes that create a pellicle. 
---

---
### **Ultimate Question:** 
### The way by which B. subtilis sqitches between nomadic and sedentary lifestyles and how that relates to SinR, a global regulator of biofilm production.
---

---
### **Proximate Goal:** 
### Characterizing the major components of biofilm in B. subtilis and the role of the tasA gene product as a biofilm component and the role of YqxM as a localizing factor for biofilms.
---


### **Model** 
### B subtilis; (wt), (-tasA), and (-EPS)
---


### **Gap In Knowledge** 
### General information and knowledge about biofilm production and maintenance is limited.
---

---
### **Hypothesis:** 
### The bundling of B. subtilis is essential to the formation of biofilm and is accomplished via the production of an intact extracellular matrix. Specifically, gene products of tasA, YqxM, and EPS each contribuite to a properly functioning extracellular matrix.
---


### **Results**
### After dehydration, there is a visable difference in how the microbes are associated with the wt bacteria appearing to be coated or connected by a layer or film, tasA mutants appear to still be connected under some kind of matrix however it did not appear to coat the microbes entirely, and appeared to be more fibirous, finally the EPS mutant microbes appear to be connected by thin thread like structures however these bacteria are the most exposed. 
### tasA appears to be a component of the matrix fraction in wildtype B subtilis extracellular matrix but not apart of the ECM of xqxM pellicles.
### tasA localizes in the cell and in the ECM but not into the media and appears to require a functioning yqxM 
### sinI mutants and tasA/eps mutants have the same phenology because sinI synthesis  suppresses eps and yqxM-sipW-tasA genes and initiates the matrix production. 
### evident from the tasA, eps, sinI, and tasA/eps mutants cell chains are not sufficient to produce bundling. 
### When microbe mutants (spo0A, yqxM-sipW-tasA, and tasA) were co-inoculated with the wildtype only tasA mutant could be rescued and produced the biofilm

### **Discussion**
### Communities fromed by microbes may be the rule, not the exception and may be facilitated by the formation of biofilm. The effeect of removing tasA from the ECM limited or eliminated biofilm production. tasA in the biofilm could be required for biofilm production and could be antimicrobial (as tasA has been shown to be as such).
### SinR co-ordinatly represses the expression of yqxM-sipW-tasA operons, thereby controlling major components of biofilm production. SinR could be the binary modulator in determining sedementary vs mobile lifestyles.

### **Methods**
### Culturing microbes
### Mutant production via Bacteria transformation
### Biofilm separation, staining, and quantification
### Analysis of colony, film and ECM complementation (co-inoculations)
### Microscopy (LM, SEM)
### SDS-PAGE and Western blot of cell, pellicle, and matrix fractions
