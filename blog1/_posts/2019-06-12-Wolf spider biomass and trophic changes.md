### **Context:** 
### The impact of predators on ecosystems is relative to their biomass and a warmer climate will affect the biomass of predators. There is general aggreement that climate change will affect species interactions. There are few studies on how climate-modified trophic cascades will change ecosystem functioning. Change in the dynamics of communities do influence ecosystem function. One ecosystem and trophic interaction that is quickly changing is the above and below ground trophic interactions of the artic.

### The artic is warming rapidly and there are large stores of organic carbon in the soil. Fast warming is increasing microbe respiration in the soil, turning the artic into a C source, and increasing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere. Little work has been done to understand how belowground consumers (microbes) and their consumers will effect ecosystem function as each of these two groups is affected by climate change.

### belowground producers is effected by primary consumers (micro/macroinvertebrates) and secondary consumers (spiders). The biomass, wolf spiders are the most abundant predator in the artic. These spiders in temperate and artic environments are generalists and in those temperate regions these spiders indirectly effect the ecosystem. Recently, these spiders have been shown to prey on the detritivores (collembola) suggesting a  indirect effect of spiders on nutrient cycling and decomposition

### **Ultimate Question:** 
### How will climate change and warmer conditions effect predator biomasss and how will shifts in predator biomass effect the other trophic levels with which they interact? How will climate chage-induced effects to predators cascade through the ecosystem
---


### **Proximate Goal:** 
### How the response of the belowground community to climate change is mediated by wolf spider density and how does that cascade to litter decomposition in the belowground trophic system?
---


### **Model:** Wolf spiders, collembola, oribatid mites, microbial biomass, other above-ground predators. Measuring N, decomposition, and soil nutrient availability

### **Hypothesis:**
### **1** more wolf spiders = less collembola, **2** less collembola = more fungi = more decomposition, and **3** the effect of these spiders would be strengthened by warming.
---


### **Results**
### Spider population dynamics maintained artifically throughout the experiment. 3 population densities (high = twice the season average, med = season average, low). Plots were also artificially warmed.
### The interactive effects of the predators on the ecosystem was analyzed using a number of different mixed models

### **Figure 1**
### **A:** Interactions between spiders and collembola in ambient and warmed environments. 
### Ambient: low spider density = highest collembola density. High spider = lowest collembola
### Warmed: low spider density = lowest collembola density. High spider = highest collembola
### **B:** Interaction between spiders and other predators in ambient and warmed treatments. 
### Ambient: Control spider density = highest other density. High spider = lowest other
### Warmed: Low spider density = highest other. High spider = lowest other

### **Table 1**
### Plots across each treatment showed significantly fewer collembola from the order Symphyplenoa then the Entomobrymorpha. 
### Soil mosisture was a significant predictor of collembola densities
### Higher micobial biomass was reported in soil with more moist. No significant differences detected in microbial biomass across the treatments tested

### **Figure 2**
### **A:** Using litter bag mass measures to determine the role of spider density on the rate of decomposition.
### Ambient: Low spider = highest percent mass remained. High spider = lowest litter remained
### Warmed: Low spider density = lowest litter remaining. High spider = highest litter remaining
### **B:** Measuring N remaining in litter bags
### Ambient: Control spider density = lowest N remaining. High spider = highest N remaining  
### Warmed: Low spider density = highest N remaining. High spider = lowest N remaing
### **C:** Measuiring the amount of NH4+ available in the soil after 6 weeks
### Low spider density = lowest amount of NH4+ available. High spider density = highest NH4+ available

### **Discussion**
### Higher spider densities alone lead to smaller densities of below ground collembola and increased litter decomposition. Under warmer conditions and higher spider densities did the reverse.
### Increasing spider density had no effect on other predator densities.
### THese findings suggest the indirect influence of higher spider densities on lowering collembola densities and influencing decomposition. Also higher spider populations was correlated with higher soil nitrogen N regardless of temperature treatment.
### Generally, warmer temps = more top predators = less intermediate consumers = more decomposition, they found more decomposition. This implies an indirect trophic cascade link.
### The same frame should hold when temps warm up, they found less decomposition. This could be explained by the higher collembola densities in that treatment 
### the effect size of these results below ground are similar to studies that examine these types of interactions above ground
