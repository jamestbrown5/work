### **Context:** 
### Dybiosis is microbial imbalance or maladaptation and has been linked to chronic diseases in humans. Recent interests has sparked a need for a model system to understand the principles that govern this dynamic process. There is a need to understand how these flies maintain their microbiome.

### **Ultimate Question:** 
### Is microbial growth in the gut of animals enough to maintain gut microbiota? Are microbes replenished?
---

---
### **Proximate Goal:** 
### How do animals obtain and maintain thier microbiome? The mode of action for of these microbes in SWD immunity and its relation to the action of probiotics administered to humans
