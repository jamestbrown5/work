title: Life history consequences of developing in anthropogenic noise

### **Context:** 
### When environments change negative effects can usually be amelioriated by plasticity however plasticity to novel changes can be insufficient or maladaptive. Noise is a novel change and could effect "lifetime fitness" of field crickets.
---

---
### **Ultimate Question:** 
### What effect does noise, a novel anthropogenic environmental change have on lifetime fitness.
---

---
### **Proximate Goal:** 
### The effect of traffic noise on field cricket ontogeny, lifespan, reproductive output.
---


### **Model** 
### Field crickets in traffic noise treatments that vary by length of exposure to noise and whether those noises are masking (novel and native noises that overlap) or non-masking (novel and native noises that do not overlap)
---


### **Gap In Knowledge** 
### Frequently, research focuses on specific developmental time points however plasticity can have addative or even multiplicative effects on fitness. Also research tends to focus on vertebrates 
---

---
### **Hypothesis:** 
### Anthropogenic noise is a novel change that animals have not experienced historically and may overlap with sound spectrums animals have evolved to respond. The way plastic traits will respond to novel noises will be varied and deleterious. 
---


### **Results**
### Successfully mated females: masking noise does not affect reproductive investment
### Development: Masking noise affected development time (11 more days to adult). Nonmasking noise crickets develop time (15% longer) 
### Lifespan: Masking noise crickets (lived 9 less days).

### **Discussion**

---
### **Methods**
### Treatment: Incubator cricket rearing in 3 different treatments: mask, nonmask, none 
### Stats: ANCOVA for life history traits, Bionomial Mixed Effects GLM for differences in binary trait measures with model selection via Chi Square tests, and mixed effects  ANCOVAs for continuous measures. ANCOVA for development and adult life span, a third ANCOVA for the effect of development time on adult lifespan and a model  to determine if acoustics directly effeectd adult lifespan or if it was mediated through development time.  Because development  time and lifespan were affected by acoustics and in turn affects reproductive traits measured they ran an ANCOVA with development time and adult size as covariates and another with just adult size as covariate
