#### **Title** 
##### Olfactory Specialization in Drosophila suzukii Supports an Ecological Shift in Host Preference from Rotten to Fresh Fruit

#### **Model:** 
##### D. suzukii and D. biarmipes vs Fruit ripeness volatiles in two choice-assays

#### **Question:** 
##### Which part of the fruit and the ripening process is most attractive to SWD

#### **Goal:** 
##### More clearly define the relationship between the neuroethology of isoprenoid leaf volatiles, neuron ligand ab3A, and D. suzukii and D. biarmipes. To further advance IPM efforts to control SWD. Understand the mechanisms that make D. suzukii prefer ripening fruit  

#### **Methods:** 
##### Wild-type D. suzukii and D. biarmipes and D. melanogaster from stocks males and females (2-7days old), HS GC-MS, library comparisons (trapping exp explained in detail), GC-EAD, and GC-SSR   

#### **Context**
#####

#### **Results**
##### Figure 1: |Using the existing lit (not referenced) they identified basiconic sensillia types for each drosophila species and compared them

#### **Discussion**
