### **Protocol Test 1:**
### Pellicle Dispersal  
### B. subtilis disaggregation protocol taken from https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/46.3.397, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msec.2015.11.036, and doi:10.1099/mic.0.27709-0
### Test tube containing B. subtilis was vortexed (5mins) then sonicated (1min on high) and vortexed again (1min on high)
### 2.5mL of the sample was placed into two new culture tubes and 5mL of TSB broth was added to the sample. Each culture was placed into incubator and temp was set to 32C

### B. subtilis practice
### 4 culture tubes of B. subtilis were started and incubated at 32C
### THese samples will be uysed to test dispersal protocol and will be analyzed using the spectrophotometer
