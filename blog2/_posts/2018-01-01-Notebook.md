Attendee's: Dan Hahn, John Beck, Rob Meagher
James' take on proposal presentation
  Prior to delivering the talk at 0930 on Jan 5th 2018, I arrived in the seminar room at 0730a and tested the equipment and delivered a mock talk. I started from the begining (read: introduction/title slide) and ended with the thank you slide as though I was delivering it to an audience. During that time I felt confident and assured that I was doing well to hit all the marks. Specifically, I introduced information linearly, gave time for pauses, and engaged the audience (read: empty chairs) in eye contact.
  When the time came for the proposal presentation with the live audience I was a bit rattled. During the talk I tried to present the information as linearly as possible. However there were time that I feel I lost my train of thought. I think the loss of thought was a consequence of having not been as prepared as I could have been.

Committee comments following proposal
Rob:

1. Literature - Rob is willing to assist me in reviewing literature that could assist me in better understand how ECB fits into its varied global ecology.
2. Confidence - Rob, in agreement with John and Dan, suggests that the question session after a seminar is the perfect time to speculate. Specifically, if someone asks me a question I may not necessarily know the answer to it is perfectly fine for me to say, "I do not know the answer, but here is what I think...."
3. Admin - I need to email Rob and schedule meeting times with him for the semester.

John:

1. Presentation tips: John would like my presentations to include expected questions from the audience. This could contexualize the Q&A session after my talk and possibly ensure I am prepared for said question session.

Dan:

1. Big picture - Dan would like to more growth from me and my research as it relates to a larger picture or perspective. Specifically, how does this work fit into the larger body of knowledge, why does my research matter (think IPM, big physiology questions, and evolution). When it comes to presenting my research to the scientific community or any community I need to make sure I am answering the question, "How does this work fill a gap in scientific knowledge?".
2. Synthesis - The questions I was asked after my presentation suggest I am uncomfortable or less confident with synthesizing data or information on the fly (for lack of a better phrase). Dan suggests I read literature more broadly to better understand the relationship between my study system and its ecological position. Also I would benefit from continuing my education in evolution.
3. Admin - With Rob as a resource, I will be starting weekly or biweekly literature meetings with R. Meagher and Dan would like the contents of those meetings shared using GitHub.

USDA with Jeremiah

**Jeremiah:**

1. Talked about schedule - Wednesday and Friday from 1pm until 5pm should be a go
2. Discussed in detail the project we are doing and how it related to national food security, insect pest management, diapause research, etc. In short, I reviewed the "ECB" and "Experimental" sections of my proposal. Jeremiah asked alot of interesting questions and eexpresses an interest in insect chemical ecology, agricultural engineering (genetic/biological control), push and pull ag-systems, etc.
3. Discussed with Jeremiah the possibility of completing an independent project, scholarship opportunities (which I will look into), and the possibility of remaining at the USDA for the long term.
4. Gave Jeremiah a introduction to general lab safety: fire exits, emergency information, decontamination stations, and PPE locations.
5. Discussed in general the lipid extraction procedure.

**Erin:**

1. Laid out lipid samples for Erin to practice the FAME protocol
2. Erin arrived at the USDA around 1pm and was able to complete the entire procedure (11 samples) by 1439.
3. I did not get the opportunity to interact with her because I was on campus doing respirometry

**Meeting with Andrew**

- Introduced me to software necessary to create and modify lab protocols
- Installed and tested software
- Discussed the outline and approch to creating protocols using R markdown
- Discussed the goal and necessity of using version control software to track revisions and ensure my science is reproducible.

Respirometry:

####**Tasks and To-Do's**

1. Check FID run and determnination the status of the Hexanes
  * instrument blanks compared to an "ovenblank" and there were some peaks that occured in both the chromatograms around 20k in intensity.
  * Oven turned up to 240C in an attempt to remove the latent peaks from 10am until 2pm. Oven blank ran immediately following column baking.
    * comparison between solvent blank and oven blank
    * oven blank removed many of the extra peaks 
    * further investigation needs to be conducted to determine the source of the rocky baseline during solvent blank runs.
  * Ran Pentane, Hexanes, and Dichloromethane to test instrument baseline. 
2. Check on larvae
3. Run TLC plate on vials in the freezer
   * Push to Friday
4. Input and organize data on GitHub
5. Schedule a date and time to meet with Rob
   * Push to Friday
6. Email Nancy with a ENSO club reminder: missed
7. Class
   * practice loading data into sas and begin group assignment
8. Read 2 broad articles about diapause metabolism
   * push to Friday


#### **Working with Erin**

1. Update FAME protocol
   * add instruction for thawing, aliquoiting, and storing samples and standards while speedvac cools down
   * add volume and mass to samples and standards.
2. Shadowed Erin during FAME derivitization to ensure she was equiped and capable of running the FAME method without supervision.
   * Positives: 
     * She walked me through the entire process and asked questions about the theories and mechanisms that she was confused about. 
     * Her dexterity is impressive
     * She explained to me that she was confortable with the FAME process and that she is ready to move on to working on "real samples"
     * she is willing to run 14 reaction vials during one analysis.
       * 8 samples, 3 reaction blanks, and 3 triglyceride standards plus 1 FAME standard and 1 instrument blank
   * Needs Improvement:
     * Handling pipeters
       * avoid inverting them when transferring solutions 
     * When quenching the reaction
       * while keeping the vial inplace, acid needs to be added directly to the reaction.
     * Working in the hood
       * be careful not to place equipment and tools directly onto the LabMat
     * Operating the SpeedVac
       * explained operation procedure for the SpeedVac
   * Future directions:
     * During her next work day she and I will go through the process of running samples on the FID. 
     * Erin is interested in a career in agriculture and indicated to me that she would like to volunteer for the USDA until she graduates.
     * When needed, we will go through the process to properly dilute acids and bases used for the FAME reaction

USDA 0800-1000

* GC FID:
  * compared chromatograms
  * ran more solvent and oven blanks
  * conducted inlet maintenance
  * altered FAME method to make the inlet temp the same as the post run temp
  * determmined how to sleep the instrument
    * before performing a run select the sleep method
    * organize the sequence
    * run the sequence with your method of choice
    * after the sequence is completed, the GC will default back to the sleep method
* Larvae maintenance

UF 1030-1345: 

* Seminar: vector borne diseases
  1. interesting stuff however it became a bit technical and some if the talk was lost on me.
     * he discussed how his research focuses on "curing" mosquitoes of malaria
     * he discussed how recently infected mosquitoes seek out the extrafloral nectar of this one pest weed species
     * he discussed how the treatment he is developing works in two ways
       * first the vaccine (an antibody treatment that blocks the membrane protein that binds the malaria parasite) is micronized and injected  into the lymph tissue of the patient
         * on the same dose date a bundle of antigen is injected that slowly releases antigen into the blood stream for upto 6 months. This slow release thing acts as a booster

#### **Respirometry**:

#### **Meeting**
1. Respirometry data looks interesting and we should be thinking about ways to make these figures more impactful
2. With the larvae in BE conditions: relocate less than half of the larvae into "long-day" conditions and monitor for 7 to 10 days
3. Continue to monitor UZ until day 35 and re-asses with Dan
  * There seems to be an interesting effect of UZ metabolic activity at the begining of the respirometry. Try to apply a meaning to that.
4. Remove pupa and adults from the graph, compare the means between larvae only

##### Introduction

|Quote|"...parasitoid wasp, Macrocentrus cingulum, that killed more than 50% of the larvae overwintering on mugwort"|
|---|---|
|Note|THis difference in parasitism in the mugwort host is intersting. Review some lit|

|Quote|"...Sympatric speciation was considered implausible because the conditions required were thought by many to be very unlikely to occurin nature, notably due to the selection/recombination antag-onism identified by Felsenstein"|
|---|---|
|Note|argument agains sympatric specation|

|Quote|"...habitat- or host-plant-based assortative mating"|
|---|---|
|Note|argument for sympatric speciation|

|Quote|"...In Europe, its main hosts are maize (Zea mays) and mugwort (Artemisia vulgaris; Thompson and Parker 1928)."|
|---|---|
|Note|host plant variety and life history|

|Quote|"...The second polymorphic trait involved in reproductive iso-
lation is the number of generations per year (Stengel and Schubert 1982; Glover et al. 1992). Populations of ECB are classified into genetically univoltine (U) population with a compulsory diapause and genetically bivoltine (B) popula- tions with a facultative diapause."|
|---|---|
|Note|ecologically cumpulsory|

|Quote|"For all three sets of stalks for the maize race, we found no deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations at any individual locus or across all loci (Table 4). Conversely, several deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were found within the mugwort race (Table 4)."|
|---|---|
|Note|HW-genetic variation in the pop is constant w/o disturbance|

|Quote|"The Tpi locus showed a significant deficit of heterozygotes in overwintering larvae (fˆ? 0.248, P ? 0.035) and in moths emerging in laboratory conditions (fˆ ? 0.449, P ? 0.040), but not in moths emerging in natural conditions (fˆ? 0.079, P? 0.663). Moths emerging in natural conditions displayed a major deficit of heterozygotes at both the Mpi (fˆ ? 0.484, P ? 0.001) and the Pgm (fˆ ? 0.414, P ? 0.001) loci, responsible for the significant deficit in heterozygotes detected across all loci (fˆ ? 0.215, P ? 0.001; Table 4)."|
|---|---|
|Note|mugwort: less Tpi heteros in lab, less mpi and pgm heteros in nature|


##### Discussion

|Sex Pheromone Composition|
|---|
|" Males respond maximally to the pheromone blend of their own race (Priesner and Baltensweiler 1987)." "...In laboratory conditions, Z males do not respond to the E blend and very few E males respond to the Z blend (Glover et al. 1990)." "... Finally, assor-tative mating between the two races may be further enhanced because of the differences in calling periodicity between the E and Z ECB."|

|Voltinsim|
|---|
|"...we concluded that the popu-lation collected on maize was bivoltine Z (bivoltine using Z pheromone), whereas the population sampled on mugwort was mainly, although not exclusively, bivoltine E (bivoltine using E pheromone)."|

| 2011 Folcher et. al | Changes in Parasitoid Communities Over Time and Space: A Historical Case Study of the Maize Pest O. nubilalis| O. nubilalis, O. scapulalis, and associated parasitoids | We document here changes in the larval parasitoid communities of Ostrinia nubilalis — the main pest of maize — and its sibling species O. scapulalis, based on two historical datasets, one collected from 1921 1928 and the other from 2001–2005. Each of these datasets encompasses several years and large geographical areas and was based on several thousands/millions of host larvae. | We provide here an analysis of the complete dataset for the larval ECB parasitoid community obtained from 2001 to 2005 by the French Ministry of Agriculture. | We compared this dataset with the USDA dataset for 1921 1928, to determine (i) whether and to what extent the larval parasitoid communities of O. nubilalis and O. scapulalis had changed over a 80-year period marked by intense environmental modifications, (ii) whether these changes were of similar magnitude for the two main groups of parasitoids, tachinids and hymenopterans and (iii) whether the expansion of O. nubilalis into the range of O. scapulalis driven by human activity was accompanied by changes in diversity and, more specifically, by any phenomenon of parasite release, "spill over" or "spill back".
Results|

|Quote|Parasitoids following their hosts into new areas may eventually parasitise native hosts in the newly colonized habitats, a situation known as parasite ‘‘spill over’’ [42,43]. Finally, parasitoids already established in areas into which the species with the expanding range moves may switch host to the invader from resident host species related to the invader, triggering a parasite ‘‘spill back’|
|---|---|
|Note|spill over: host range expansion = parasitoid range expansion. could lead to parasitoid preferring native hosts to invader host  ---- spill back: native parasioids prefering invader hosts to native hosts|

|Quote| "Meanwhile, population genetics and ecological studies showed that the Ostrinia larvae feeding on mugwort actually belonged to O. scapulalis, a sibling species of O. nubilalis [56]. Although interfertile and similar morphologically, these two species are genetically differentiated from each other and feed on different host plants: mugwort, hop (Humulus lupulus L.) and hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) for O. scapulalis and maize for O. nubilalis (see [56] for a review). For unknown reasons, O. scapulalis is mostly restricted to northern France [53,57]. A few larvae of this species have been detected on mugwort in central France [53,54] but it does not infest this weed in southern France [53,57]."|
|---|---|
|Note|these two ostrinia "species" have different ranges and although the hosts are available throughout the distribution of both "species"|

|Quote|This difference in H9 resulted
mostly from the decrease in PR over time documented above.|
|---|---|
|Note|H' = diversity index --- PR = parasitism rates|

|Quote| "The mean PR per site in the newly colonized regions was half that in the ancestral regions (Table 3).
PR per site in the intermediate regions was twice that in ancestral regions and four times that in newly colonized regions
For all parasitoids considered together, the mean SR per site in the newly colonized regions was one half to one third that in the intermediate and ancestral regions, respectively"|
|---|---|
|Note|SR = species richness, |

##### Discussion
|Overview|
|---|
| "...differences in abundance, composition and richness between these two periods of time probably result from real and durable changes within the parasitoid communities rather than biased and/or limited sampling.|

|Changes in parasitoid community over time|
|---|
|for O. nubilalis, parasitism rates have declined but species richness has not changes. For O. scapulalis, parasitism rates have NOT declined  but species richness has declined. THe decline in SR could be due to the range expansion of one braconid wasp and the loss of one species|
|---|
|O. nubilalis and O. Scapulalis infestation densities have not changed between the 1920s and 2000s|
|---|
|Lower species richness in O. nubilalis could be due to the introduction of herbicides and pesticides in managed agro-ecosystems in which they live.|

|Changes in ECB range and parasite community|
|---|
|Parasitism rate reduction in ECB regions could be due to the enemy free space provided by maize introduction|

|1- Heat treatment increased spore innoculation and reduced survival. 2- As seasonal temps increase with decreasing latitude, ECB survival decreases. 3- corn at tiftin may have been superior|

|Diapause|
|---|
|1- This study attemps to show the interation between photoperiod and temperature as in the diapause response as a function of ecotype. 2- the interaction between photoperiod and temperature does vary as temperatre and photoperiod icidence varies across latitude. NOTE this variation in diapause responce also varies with ecotype. 3 - this ecotype specificty couold be confounded by the fact that there are more than one strain within each collection. THe larvae that were collected from each location were collected during diapause. Depending on when these larvae were collected in the life stage of the insects lives there could be a unique mixture of different strains of ECB in each collection site which was not conotrolled for in the present experiment|

| Iga, M et al. | Pigment Dispersing Factor Regulates Ecdysone Biosynthesis via Bombyx Neuropeptide G Protein Coupled Receptor-B2 in the Prothoracic Glands of Bombyx mori | Bombyx mori | What are the receptors involved in the biogenesis of ecdysone | Tissue cultures - Small molecule inhibitors - Transcriptome library production via RNA-seq tags - cDNA library production via Q-PCR - Phylogenic tree production via MUSCLE analysis - Receptor testing via production of HEK293 cell lines of BNGR-B2 or pME18s receptors - Ecdysone titer quant via LC-MS/MS - Receptor ID via western blot|


|Summary|
|---|
|In an effort to expose novel regulatory pathways important in the production of ecdysone, these researchers began their search starting with receptors known to be produced by the biogenic tissues that produced ecdysone and worked forward to find corresponding ligands. They discover that a novel g-coupled receptor (BNGR-B2) in the biogenic pathway and its ligand, PDF (a neuropeptide). |
|---|
|Screening: RNA seq tags were aligned to Bombyx transcriptome. the rate of expression in the PG tissue was compared to the rate of brain tissue and 3 candidates were selcted: torso, BNGR-A34 and BNGR-B2|
|---|
|Character of BNGR-B2: larvae were starved and RT-pcr was done on PG across several time point. The flux of this receptor was correlated with ecdysone titers (previous lit titers)|
|---|
|Character of BNGR-B2: the amino acid sequence is similar to the PDHR and DH31 (homologues). This info was used to select ligand canidates. BNGR-B2 and an empty protein receptor were expressed in a cell line and those two ligands were tested against each line.|
|---|
|Effect of ligand on PG tissue: PG tissue cultured with each ligand and ecdysone titers quantified. PDF was able to flux titers. PDF dose response was tested. PG tissues across several larval stage timepoints was tested. When PG's were dosed with PDF or PTTH with and without calcium, Ecdysone titer production quantified.|
|---|
|Signaling path of PDF mediated ecdysone biogenesis: because of the flux of cAMP given PDF, PDF is likely associated with a cAMP response element and is possibly controlling transcription of some factor inmportant to ecdysone biogenesis-NO joy when tested. BUT PKA translation inhibitor did effect ecdysone synthesis. |
|---|
|PDF mediated phosphorylation: Previous lit says MAPK and TOR paths are indicted in the biosynthesis of ecdysone. |

|**Discussion**|
|---|
|During V4, PG tissues can respond to PTTH because the receptor is available (but during this time PTTH titer is low). Calcium is necessary for the induction of ecdysone synth via PTTH but not PDF. When calcium is depleted, cAMP titers are not effected. The transcription inhibitor molecules in the presence of PDF did not inhibit the transcription of ecdysone transcription WHILE translation inhibition did!|

|Summary|
|---|
|  A major concern in biology is the question about how will plants and animals respond as temperatures continue to increase. Understanding how animals respond to temperature will help us to predict how habitats might be affected by changes in animals diversity. As it relates to agriculture, understanding the relationship between an insect pest and the environmental temperatures it experiences will be an important factor in how we manage insect pests. One way to frame the relationship between insects and environmental temperatures is to consider them categorically as winners or losers and thermal tolerance is a quantifiable scale use to measure the response of said insect to environmental temperatures. |
|**Losers:** increasing environemtal temperatures for these insects exceed their thermal maximum and eventually cause mortality. 
**Winners:** increasing environmental temperatures for these insects would increase within the thermal limits and could even reach their thermal optimum. |
|* Winners could have wider thermal breadths and tolerate warmer temperatures. |
|* Winners, whose thermal environment is currently below their thermal optimum, could experience increased performance as temperatures increase towards their thermal optimum. |
|  Deutsch et al. (2008) tracked and compared population size between 38 representative insect species from temperate and tropical latitudes. For those representative species across temperate latitudes, the thermal breadth of these insects tended to be wider and the thermal conditions experienced in these locations, on average, tended to be further away from their critical thermal maximum compared to the representative taxa from tropical latitudes. |
|  In the tropics, environmental temperatures vary little relative to temperatures in temperate regions and insects in tropical regions experience temperatures that tend to be closer to their optimum temperature relative to temperate insects whose environment tends to be cooler than optimum. This suggests that tropical insects already live near their thermal limits and thus could quickly become losers as climate warms. |

| Echeverri, et al. | [Control of signaling alignment during the dynamic courtship display of a jumping spider](https://github.com/jamestbrown5/Notebook_Protocols/blob/master/Literature/2017_Echeverri%20et%20al._Control%20of%20signaling%20alignment%20during%20the%20dynamic%20courtship%20display%20of%20a%20jumping%20spider.pdf) | Habronattus pyrrithrix (Jumping Spider) | Receiving signals can be effected by angle and direction of perception. How do animals establish and maintain signal alignment? | To characterize the spatial dynamics of visual courtship | Recorded relative positions of actors during courtship: movement, orientation of males and females when female movement was fixed and free |

|**Summary**|
|---|
|Visual signals and systems often have strong directional biasis and selection should lead to behaviors that increase alignment:
   1-Tendancy for angle dependancy implies spatial limits: change in visual signal due to distance
   2-Intrinsic sensitivity biasis of signals due to system preceiving the signal: view field and signal reception limits|

|**Introduction:**|
|---|
|   1-Both males and females studied during courtship
      a: during displays males behavior is stereotypical and icludes ornaments depending on distance from the receiver
      b: these movements are obsecured depending on viewing angle due to the visual limits of female color sight and the location of the color signals on the male
**Questions:**
   1-To what extent is alignment established and maintained during courtship
   2-What are the contributions of each actor to alignment|

|**Methods**|
|---|
|   1- spiders from arizona and kept at constant temp, RH, and LD. Food 2x body mass. Court trials held 3 months 4 months and 8 months after capture
   2- Court trial
      a: was 10mins, 8 pairs of wild adults were trialed and results compared to later cohorts
      b: n=14 for stationary trials, n=12 for turning trials, continuous court=60s display|

|**Results**|
|---|
|   1- Analysis of manipulation experiments reveals dynamic interx during courtship between actors
    2- Live Males and Live Females:
      a: Live Females: Males at long range did little orientation in the direction of the female and males at short range orientated face-towards female
      b: Model Females: Males at long range orientated face-towards female as did short range males|

|**Summary** Hypothesis: Instead of tilling, mowing to control the natural vegetation of olive orchard in spring can increase biodiversity and improve soil quality, without negative effects in production|
|---|
| Olive production did not differ between treatments in any of the years. Soil water was higher in NVM, at both soil depths, particularly in mid-summer and after the first autumn rains (1 to 2%). Soil resistance to penetration was 1 Mpa higher in NVM than in NVT. As compared to conventional tillage, natural vegetation cover mowed in spring seems to be an effective management practice to improve the overall rainfed olive orchard biodiversity and soil quality, without affecting production|

|Title|Plant pathogenic fungi decrease in soil inhabited by seed-dispersing ants |
|---|---|
|Model|Aphaenogaster spp.| 
|---|---|
|Question?|If fungal protection is a potential benefit of ant-mediated dispersal, we expected that ant-occupied soil (soils inhabited by ants for colony nesting) would contain fewer phytopathogenic fungi than proximate soils without ant nests.|
|---|---|
|Goal|investigated published Aphaenogaster soil fungi data and conducted our own metataxonomic analysis of ant-occupied and unoccupied soils to identify phytopathogenic fungi and investigate whether ant colony presence corresponds with reduced plant fungal pathogens in the soil| 
|---|---|
|Introduction/Importance|The obvious benefit of animal- mediated dispersal is movement—it allows the colonization of new habitat. A somewhat cryptic benefit is the escape from negative density-dependent conditions near parental plants, where intraspecific competitors, as well as predators and pathogens|
|---|Finally, directed dispersal suggests that animals may not necessarily save seeds from adverse con- ditions, but deliver them into sites or microhabitats more favorable for survival|
|---|In the tropics, ants “clean” seeds by removing fruit tissue from the seed coat (Guimaraes and Cogni 2002). Seeds cleaned by ants suffer less fungal attack and have improved germination rates than non-cleaned seeds and seeds cleaned by hand|
|---|metapleural glands, which are paired organs on the sides of ants that secrete a waxy, acidic anti-microbial substance.... Whereas metapleural and mandibular compounds specifically inhibit entomopathogenic bacteria and fungi, they also inhibit many additional bacterial and fungal spe- cies with no known ant or insect pathogenicity|

##### Notes
|Quote|We used Cohen’s d effect size to quantify the size of the differ- ence between treatment levels (ant occupied and control)|
|---|---|
|Note|The use of effect size|

|Quote|Eighty-four percent of all fungal species were more fre-quent in unoccupied than occupied, and 53% of those were plant pathogens|
|---|---|
|Note|without ants fungtal richness inccreases by 84% with 54% of that total being plant pathogens|

|Quote|Our soil replicates were limited, and by taking field soil samples, we could not control for length of occupation, as the anti- microbial effects may be cumulative. Moreover, it is possible that the ants selected microhabitats to colonize that already included low phytopathogenic fungi|

| Summary/Abstract |
|---|
|This book provides a modern, synthetic overview of interactions between insects and their environments from a physiological perspective that integrates information across a range of approaches and scales. It shows that evolved physiological responses at the individual level are translated into coherent physiological and ecological patterns at larger, even global scales. This is done by examining in detail the ways in which insects obtain resources from the environment, process these resources in various ways, and turn the results into energy which allows them to regulate their internal environment as well as cope with environmental extremes of temperature and water availability. The book demonstrates that physiological responses are not only characterized by substantial temporal variation, but also show coherent variation across several spatial scales. At the largest, global scale, there appears to be substantial variation associated with the hemisphere in which insects are found. Such variation has profound implications for patterns of biodiversity as well as responses to climate change, and these implications are explicitly discussed. The book provides a novel integration of the understanding gained from broad-scale field studies of many species and the more narrowly focused laboratory investigations of model organisms. In so doing, it reflects the growing realization that an integration of mechanistic and large-scale comparative physiology can result in unexpected insights into the diversity of insects. |
