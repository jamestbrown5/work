### **Protocol Test 1:**
### Pellicle Fractioning
### B. subtilis protocol taken from doi:10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.05020.x
### One test tube containing B. subtilis and alginate were first subjected to mild sonication. Then centrifuged at 7196 rfc at 4C for 20 mins
### Result: After centrifugation the supernatant of the sample was not turbinant. The microbes and the alginate appeared to be completely pelleted at the bottom of the tube.

### **Protocol Test 2:** 
### The test tube containing the B. subtilis from protocol 1 was used in this test. ### Microbes transferred into large vials used for high speed centrifugation. 

---

### 1. Microbe samples transferred into large vials
### 2. An additional 30ml of TSB broth was transferred into large vials
### 3. Large vials were fitted into the superspeed centrifuge
### Centrifuge: Sorovall RC-5B   Rotor: HS-4   
### Speed calculator for rotor: http://www.sciencegateway.org/tools/rotor.htm

---

### **Outcome:** 
### Centrifuge did not complete the method that was set and the run was terminated prematurely. 
### Possible cause could have been turbulance during the method caused by large vials not being fitted securely into rotor. 
### Another cause could have been the temperature setting may have been improperly set during the run method
